3. Explain Javascript History ?
Ans - 
JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that has evolved significantly since its creation. Here's a brief overview of its history:
Creation and Early Days (1995):
Brendan Eich: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Initially, it was developed in just 10 days and was originally named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript.
Netscape Navigator 2.0: JavaScript was first released with Netscape Navigator 2.0 in December 1995. It was designed to make web pages interactive and dynamic.
Standardization (1996-1997):

ECMAScript: To ensure cross-browser compatibility, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, resulting in the ECMAScript standard. The first edition of ECMAScript (ES1) was published in June 1997.
Microsoft's JScript: Microsoft developed its own version of JavaScript, called JScript, which was included in Internet Explorer 3.0. This led to a period of browser incompatibility.
Evolution and Growth (1998-2008):

ECMAScript 3 (ES3): Released in December 1999, ES3 introduced important features like regular expressions, better string handling, and try/catch error handling.
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): Around 2005, Ajax became popular, enabling asynchronous web applications that could update web pages without reloading. This was a major factor in the rise of dynamic web applications.
Libraries and Frameworks: JavaScript libraries like jQuery, Prototype, and MooTools emerged, simplifying cross-browser compatibility and DOM manipulation.
Modern JavaScript (2009-Present):

ECMAScript 5 (ES5): Released in December 2009, ES5 brought significant improvements such as strict mode, JSON support, and more robust object properties.
Node.js (2009): Created by Ryan Dahl, Node.js allowed JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, greatly expanding its capabilities and uses.
ECMAScript 6 (ES6/ECMAScript 2015): Released in June 2015, ES6 introduced major features like let/const variables, arrow functions, classes, modules, template literals, destructuring, promises, and more.
Further Versions: Subsequent annual updates (ES7, ES8, etc.) have continued to introduce new features and improvements, such as async/await, new data structures, and additional syntax enhancements.
Current Trends:

Frameworks and Libraries: Modern JavaScript development heavily relies on frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js, and Svelte.
Tooling: Tools like Babel, Webpack, and ESLint help developers write, compile, and manage JavaScript code more efficiently.
TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript, TypeScript, developed by Microsoft, adds static typing to the language and has gained significant popularity.
